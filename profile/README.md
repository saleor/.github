Saleor is an API-first commerce platform for solving complex commerce use cases. It's a GraphQL-native, tech-agnostic commerce engine that gives you a single layer to connect all selling channels and build the best customer experience. Saleor provides standard commerce modules like Checkout, Payments, Products, and Shipping, but let's you delegate each commerce function to apps of your choice. While Saleor is an Open Source project, it offers Cloud options.
